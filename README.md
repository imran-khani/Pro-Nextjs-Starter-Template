## Description

This template demonstrates a professional way to structure a Next.js project, ideal for developers working on large-scale applications. It includes organized directories for core application logic, reusable components, custom hooks, TypeScript types, and global styles. The structure is designed to support scalable and maintainable development, making it easy to manage complex applications over time.

### Key Features

- **App Directory:** Contains the main application logic, including routing, layout, and API routes.
- **Components Directory:** Houses reusable UI, form, and layout components, promoting modularity and code reuse.
- **Lib Directory:** Centralizes core functionality and utility functions, making it easy to access and manage shared logic.
- **Hooks Directory:** Encapsulates custom React hooks, allowing for a clean and organized way to manage state and side effects.
- **Types Directory:** Stores TypeScript types, ensuring strong type safety and improving code readability.
- **Styles Directory:** Keeps global and component-specific styles organized, facilitating consistent styling across the application.
- **Public Directory:** Contains static assets such as images, ensuring easy access and management of public files.

## How to Clone and Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imran-khani/Pro-Nextjs-Starter-Template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-nextjs-project-template
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Start Building Your Application:** Begin by adding your core logic, components, and features within the appropriate directories.

### Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused; break down larger components into smaller, reusable pieces.
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple components.
- Centralize your API interactions in the `lib/api.ts` file to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Use TypeScript for type safety and to catch potential errors during development.
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase by following the directory structure provided.

This template serves as a strong foundation for developing professional, scalable, and maintainable Next.js applications. Happy coding!
